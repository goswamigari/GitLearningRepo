4. git commit -m "commit message"
commit chanes to head

(git commit -am "message"
to add to staging area and commit with message together

5. git rm --cached <file_name>
to remove files from staging area

6. git branch <branch_name>
to create new branch with branch_name

7. git checkout <branch_name>
to switch from current branch to another

8. git merge <branch_name>
to merge branch into current branch, for this you need to be in the current branch


GITHUB commands
echo "#GitLearningRepo" >> README.md
git init 
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"


9. git remote add origin https://github.com/goswamigari/GitLearningRepo.git
to push an existing repository from the command line

10. git remote -v
to check how many remote repositories are present
it shows which repositories to fetch and which ones to push to 

11. git push -u origin master
master is the name of the git branch that was pulled to github

another one is the main branch (in the github profile)

12.  git push origin dev

workflow:
(git add---> git commit -->git push
     git merge              git fetch
<-----------------------<--------------
               git pull
<---------------------------------------
for merging changes in the remote github repo-->
first create pull request and then merge to the branch on github
but on the local repo on my machine you can execute 
"git merge <branch_name>" command

13. git pull
for pulling the changes that are in the remote repo to my local repo

14. create .gitignore folder--> here it saves the files that are ignored from git commands from staging and it is not pushed to the github repo/merged, etc.

15. git add .
to add all the files with all the changes made, you wont have to add them individually
